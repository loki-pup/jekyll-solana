Express is a popular unopinionated web framework, written in JavaScript and hosted within the Node.js runtime environment.

### Node

Node (or more formally Node.js) is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript.

### Express

Express is the most popular Node.js web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node.js frameworks. It provides mechanisms to:

* Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).

* Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.

* Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.

* Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.

### Is Express opinionated?

Web frameworks often refer to themselves as "opinionated" or "unopinionated".

Opinionated frameworks are those with opinions about the "right way" to handle any particular task. They often support rapid development in a particular domain (solving problems of a particular type) because the right way to do anything is usually well-understood and well-documented. However they can be less flexible at solving problems outside their main domain, and tend to offer fewer choices for what components and approaches they can use.

Unopinionated frameworks, by contrast, have far fewer restrictions on the best way to glue components together to achieve a goal, or even what components should be used. They make it easier for developers to use the most suitable tools to complete a particular task, albeit at the cost that you need to find those components yourself.

Express is unopinionated. You can insert almost any compatible middleware you like into the request handling chain, in almost any order you like. You can structure the app in one file or multiple files, and using any directory structure. You may sometimes feel that you have too many choices!

### Helloworld Express

```
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`);
});
```

The first two lines require() (import) the express module and create an Express application. This object, which is traditionally named app, has methods for routing HTTP requests, configuring middleware, rendering HTML views, registering a template engine, and modifying application settings that control how the application behaves (e.g. the environment mode, whether route definitions are case sensitive, etc.)

The middle part of the code (the three lines starting with app.get) shows a route definition. The app.get() method specifies a callback function that will be invoked whenever there is an HTTP GET request with a path ('/') relative to the site root. The callback function takes a request and a response object as arguments, and calls send() on the response to return the string "Hello World!"

The final block starts up the server on a specified port ('3000') and prints a log comment to the console. With the server running, you could go to localhost:3000 in your browser to see the example response returned.

#### Import and create modules

A module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node's require() function. Express itself is a module, as are the middleware and database libraries that we use in our Express applications.

To make objects available outside of a module you just need to expose them as additional properties on the exports object. For example, the square.js module below is a file that exports area() and perimeter() methods:

```
exports.area = function (width) {
  return width * width;
};
exports.perimeter = function (width) {
  return 4 * width;
};
```

We can import this module using require(), and then call the exported method(s) as shown:

```
const square = require("./square"); // Here we require() the name of the file without the (optional) .js file extension
console.log(`The area of a square with a width of 4 is ${square.area(4)}`);
```

If you want to export a complete object in one assignment instead of building it one property at a time, assign it to module.exports as shown below (you can also do this to make the root of the exports object a constructor or other function):

```
module.exports = {
  area(width) {
    return width * width;
  },

  perimeter(width) {
    return 4 * width;
  },
};
```

#### Use asynchronous APIs

JavaScript code frequently uses asynchronous rather than synchronous APIs for operations that may take some time to complete. A synchronous API is one in which each operation must complete before the next operation can start.

By contrast, an asynchronous API is one in which the API will start an operation and immediately return (before the operation is complete). Once the operation finishes, the API will use some mechanism to perform additional operations. For example, the code below will print out "Second, First" because even though setTimeout() method is called first, and returns immediately, the operation doesn't complete for several seconds.

```
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("First");
}, 3000);
console.log("Second");
```

#### Create route handlers

In our Hello World Express example (see above), we defined a (callback) route handler function for HTTP GET requests to the site root ('/').

> Note: You can use any argument names you like in the callback functions; when the callback is invoked the first argument will always be the request and the second will always be the response. It makes sense to name them such that you can identify the object you're working with in the body of the callback.

Routes allow you to match particular patterns of characters in a URL, and extract some values from the URL and pass them as parameters to the route handler (as attributes of the request object passed as a parameter).

Often it is useful to group route handlers for a particular part of a site together and access them using a common route-prefix (e.g. a site with a Wiki might have all wiki-related routes in one file and have them accessed with a route prefix of /wiki/). In Express this is achieved by using the express.Router object. For example, we can create our wiki route in a module named wiki.js, and then export the Router object, as shown below:

```
// wiki.js - Wiki route module

const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

// Home page route
router.get("/", function (req, res) {
  res.send("Wiki home page");
});

// About page route
router.get("/about", function (req, res) {
  res.send("About this wiki");
});

module.exports = router;
```

> Note: Adding routes to the Router object is just like adding routes to the app object (as shown previously).

To use the router in our main app file we would then require() the route module (wiki.js), then call use() on the Express application to add the Router to the middleware handling path. The two routes will then be accessible from /wiki/ and /wiki/about/.

```
const wiki = require("./wiki.js");
// â€¦
app.use("/wiki", wiki);
```

#### Use middleware

Middleware is used extensively in Express apps, for tasks from serving static files to error handling, to compressing HTTP responses.

To use third party middleware you first need to install it into your app using npm. For example, to install the morgan HTTP request logger middleware, you'd do this:

```
npm install morgan
```

> Note: Middleware and routing functions are called in the order that they are declared. For some middleware the order is important (for example if session middleware depends on cookie middleware, then the cookie handler must be added first). It is almost always the case that middleware is called before setting routes, or your route handlers will not have access to functionality added by your middleware.

The only difference between a middleware function and a route handler callback is that middleware functions have a third argument next, which middleware functions are expected to call if they are not that which completes the request cycle (when the middleware function is called, this contains the next function that must be called).

You can add a middleware function to the processing chain for all responses with app.use(), or for a specific HTTP verb using the associated method: app.get(), app.post(), etc. Routes are specified in the same way for both cases, though the route is optional when calling app.use().

```
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// An example middleware function
const a_middleware_function = function (req, res, next) {
  // Perform some operations
  next(); // Call next() so Express will call the next middleware function in the chain.
};

// Function added with use() for all routes and verbs
app.use(a_middleware_function);

// Function added with use() for a specific route
app.use("/someroute", a_middleware_function);

// A middleware function added for a specific HTTP verb and route
app.get("/", a_middleware_function);

app.listen(3000);
```

#### Serve static files

You can use the express.static middleware to serve static files, including your images, CSS and JavaScript (static() is the only middleware function that is actually part of Express). For example, you would use the line below to serve images, CSS files, and JavaScript files from a directory named 'public' at the same level as where you call node:

```
app.use(express.static("public"));
```

Any files in the public directory are served by adding their filename (relative to the base "public" directory) to the base URL. So for example:

```
http://localhost:3000/images/dog.jpg
http://localhost:3000/css/style.css
http://localhost:3000/js/app.js
http://localhost:3000/about.html
```

You can call static() multiple times to serve multiple directories. If a file cannot be found by one middleware function then it will be passed on to the subsequent middleware (the order that middleware is called is based on your declaration order).

```
app.use(express.static("public"));
app.use(express.static("media"));
```

You can also create a virtual prefix for your static URLs, rather than having the files added to the base URL. For example, here we specify a mount path so that the files are loaded with the prefix "/media":

```
app.use("/media", express.static("public"));
```

Handling errors

Errors are handled by one or more special middleware functions that have four arguments, instead of the usual three: (err, req, res, next). For example:

```
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send("Something broke!");
});
```

These can return any content required, but must be called after all other app.use() and routes calls so that they are the last middleware in the request handling process!

Express comes with a built-in error handler, which takes care of any remaining errors that might be encountered in the app. This default error-handling middleware function is added at the end of the middleware function stack. If you pass an error to next() and you do not handle it in an error handler, it will be handled by the built-in error handler; the error will be written to the client with the stack trace.

#### Use databases

Express apps can use any database mechanism supported by Node (Express itself doesn't define any specific additional behavior/requirements for database management). There are many options, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.

This works with older versions of MongoDB version ~ 2.2.33:

```
const MongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient;

MongoClient.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/animals", (err, db) => {
  if (err) throw err;

  db.collection("mammals")
    .find()
    .toArray((err, result) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      console.log(result);
    });
});
```

For MongoDB version 3.0 and up:

```
const MongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient;

MongoClient.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/animals", (err, client) => {
  if (err) throw err;

  const db = client.db("animals");
  db.collection("mammals")
    .find()
    .toArray((err, result) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log(result);
      client.close();
    });
});
```

Another popular approach is to access your database indirectly, via an Object Relational Mapper ("ORM"). In this approach you define your data as "objects" or "models" and the ORM maps these through to the underlying database format. This approach has the benefit that as a developer you can continue to think in terms of JavaScript objects rather than database semantics, and that there is an obvious place to perform validation and checking of incoming data.

#### Render data (views)

Template engines (also referred to as "view engines" in Express) allow you to specify the structure of an output document in a template, using placeholders for data that will be filled in when a page is generated. Templates are often used to create HTML, but can also create other types of documents.

Express has support for a number of template engines, notably Pug (formerly "Jade"), Mustache, and EJS. Each has its own strengths for addressing particular use cases (relative comparisons can easily be found via Internet search). The Express application generator uses Jade as its default, but it also supports several others.

In your application settings code you set the template engine to use and the location where Express should look for templates using the 'views' and 'view engine' settings, as shown below (you will also have to install the package containing your template library too!)

```
const express = require("express");
const path = require("path");
const app = express();

// Set directory to contain the templates ('views')
app.set("views", path.join(__dirname, "views"));

// Set view engine to use, in this case 'some_template_engine_name'
app.set("view engine", "some_template_engine_name");
```

The appearance of the template will depend on what engine you use. Assuming that you have a template file named "index.<template_extension>" that contains placeholders for data variables named 'title' and "message", you would call Response.render() in a route handler function to create and send the HTML response:

```
app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  res.render("index", { title: "About dogs", message: "Dogs rock!" });
});
```

#### File structure

Express makes no assumptions in terms of structure or what components you use. Routes, views, static files, and other application-specific logic can live in any number of files with any directory structure. While it is perfectly possible to have the whole Express application in one file, typically it makes sense to split your application into files based on function (e.g. account management, blogs, discussion boards) and architectural problem domain (e.g. model, view or controller if you happen to be using an MVC architecture).

In a later topic we'll use the Express Application Generator, which creates a modular app skeleton that we can easily extend for creating web applications.

## Set up a Node development environment

### Add dependencies

The following steps show how you can use npm to download a package, save it into the project dependencies, and then require it in a Node application.

Use the npm init command to create a package.json file for your application. This command prompts you for a number of things, including the name and version of your application and the name of the initial entry point file (by default this is index.js). For now, just accept the defaults:

```
npm init
```

If you display the package.json file (cat package.json), you will see the defaults that you accepted, ending with the license.

```
{
  "name": "myapp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

Now install Express in the myapp directory and save it in the dependencies list of your package.json file:

```
 npm install express
The dependencies section of your package.json will now appear at the end of the package.json file and will include Express.
```

```
{
  "name": "myapp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
```

You can start the server by calling node with the script in your command prompt:

```
node index.js
```

### Development dependencies

If a dependency is only used during development, you should instead save it as a "development dependency" (so that your package users don't have to install it in production). For example, to use the popular JavaScript Linting tool ESLint you would call npm as shown:

```
npm install eslint --save-dev
```

The following entry would then be added to your application's package.json:

```
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^7.10.0"
  }
  ```

### Running tasks

In addition to defining and fetching dependencies you can also define named scripts in your package.json files and call npm to execute them with the run-script command. This approach is commonly used to automate running tests and parts of the development or build toolchain (e.g., running tools to minify JavaScript, shrink images, LINT/analyze your code, etc.).

For example, to define a script to run the eslint development dependency that we specified in the previous section we might add the following script block to our package.json file (assuming that our application source is in a folder /src/js):

```
"scripts": {
  // â€¦
  "lint": "eslint src/js"
  // â€¦
}
```

To explain a little further, eslint src/js is a command that we could enter in our terminal/command line to run eslint on JavaScript files contained in the src/js directory inside our app directory. Including the above inside our app's package.json file provides a shortcut for this command â€” lint.

We would then be able to run eslint using npm by calling:

```
npm run-script lint
# OR (using the alias)
npm run lint
```

### Instal the Express Application Generator

The Express Application Generator tool generates an Express application "skeleton". Install the generator using npm as shown:

```
npm install express-generator -g
```

> Note: You may need to prefix this line with sudo on Ubuntu or macOS. The -g flag installs the tool globally so that you can call it from anywhere.

To create an Express app named "helloworld" with the default settings, navigate to where you want to create it and run the app as shown:

```
express helloworld
```

> Note: Unless you're using an old nodejs version (< 8.2.0), you could alternatively skip the installation and run express-generator with npx. This has the same effect as installing and then running express-generator but does not install the package on your system:

```
npx express-generator helloworld
```

The generator will create the new Express app in a sub folder of your current location, displaying build progress on the console. On completion, the tool will display the commands you need to enter to install the Node dependencies and start the app.

The new app will have a package.json file in its root directory. You can open this to see what dependencies are installed, including Express and the template library Jade:

```
{
  "name": "helloworld",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./bin/www"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "cookie-parser": "~1.4.4",
    "debug": "~2.6.9",
    "express": "~4.16.1",
    "http-errors": "~1.6.3",
    "jade": "~1.11.0",
    "morgan": "~1.9.1"
  }
}
```

Install all the dependencies for the helloworld app using npm as shown:

```
cd helloworld
npm install
```

Then run the app (the commands are slightly different for Windows and Linux/macOS), as shown below:

```
# Run helloworld on Windows with Command Prompt
SET DEBUG=helloworld:* & npm start

# Run helloworld on Windows with PowerShell
SET DEBUG=helloworld:* | npm start

# Run helloworld on Linux/macOS
DEBUG=helloworld:* npm start
```

The DEBUG command creates useful logging, resulting in an output like the following:

```
>SET DEBUG=helloworld:* & npm start

> helloworld@0.0.0 start D:\GitHub\expresstests\helloworld
> node ./bin/www

  helloworld:server Listening on port 3000 +0ms
```
